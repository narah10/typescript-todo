# Overview

I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for learning and improving. I built this To Do List software to stay updated on the latest web technologies and best practices with TypeScript. My goal is to create more user-friendly web applications as I continue to grow in the field of software engineering.

I developed a To Do List TypeScript application that takes in the user input and displays them. This application is able to complete the items that were added and when reloaded, the items will no longer be displayed. Users can add as many items as they want and this is saved into the local storage, so when users visit the application again, the items they had included before will be displayed without having to re-add everything again. It's a simple application that can take input, display and update different items added. I also used Snowpack for this project, which is a built-in support to build TypeScript files to JavaScript.
